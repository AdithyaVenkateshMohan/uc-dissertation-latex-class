\section{Gentle beginnings}

\subsection{The art of introduction}

This is where you give the first \index{impression} impression of your work. 
It is important that it comes across as interesting and worthy of study. 
Make sure you state the major problems you will solve later.
Note that now the material is double-spaced instead of single-spaced (assuming you are using the \verb+comply+ class option).
We will insert a short table so that one appears in the List of Tables.

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c|c}
    $x$ & $y$ \\
    This & That \\
    These & Those \\
    Here & There \\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{A table to supercede all other tables}

\end{table}

\subsection{Harsh second dates}

Unfortunately, not all is well-and-good in the land of make believe dissertations.
