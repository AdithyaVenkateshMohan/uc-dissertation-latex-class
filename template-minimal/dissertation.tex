\begin{document} 


%%%%% This starts the beginning material of the document. It resets the page
%%%%% numbering to start at 1 and to display as roman numerals.
\frontmatter

%%%%% This typesets the title page as defined by the uc-dissertation class.
%%%%% It takes an optional argument which, if set to 'fixed', displays the
%%%%% month and year for the date defined above by \newdate instead of \today.
\maketitle      %% or \maketitle[fixed]

%% This command typesets the abstract defined by the user with the \abstract
%% command. It starts a new page (on the right if the document is two-sided),
%% and adds the abstract to the Table of Contents (really it typesets a 
%% chapter).
\abstractpage

%% This makes the copyright page. It takes an optional argument which allows 
%% the user to choose from multiple copyrights. The default is 'all': the 
%% author reserves all rights to the document. This may be necessary depending 
%% on journal restrictions. However, by setting the optional argument to empty, 
%% i.e. [], the user can obtain a blank page instead of a copyright page (one
%% of these two things is required by UC. Also, by using the strings 'cc',
%% 'by','nc','nd', and 'sa', the user may choose a Creative Commons license.
%% The only two accepted by UC are 'cc-by-nc-nd' and 'cc-by-nc-sa'. Note that
%% the dashes are not strictly necessary and order doesn't matter. It is up to
%% the user to come up with a valid Creative Commons license.
%%
%% TODO: add a 'custom' option which allows the user to build the copyright 
%% page from scratch.
\copyrightpage
%% The above is equivalent to \copyrightpage[all]
%% \copyrightpage[]
%% \copyrightpage[cc-by-nc-nd]
%% \copyrightpage[cc-by-nc-sa]


%% This command typesets the acknowledgments defined by the user with the 
%% \acknowledgments command. It starts a new page (on the right if the document 
%% is two-sided), and adds the acknowledgments to the Table of Contents (really 
%% it typesets a chapter).
\acknowledgmentspage

%% Typeset the table of contents
\tableofcontents 


%%%%% This starts page numbering anew, with arabic numerals as opposed to the roman
%%%%% numerals of the front matter.

%%%%% We have to use mainmatter again for spacing issues and for the correct
