%%%%% Set titlepage information

%%% All desired titlepage info must be set before maketitle is called.

\title{This is a title that \\ has multiple lines} 
\subtitle{This subtitle is fairly short}

%% The next command is a redefined date command that takes two
%% arguments of the form {month}{year}, where 'month' is the 
%% two-digit month, and 'year' is the four-digit year. In order 
%% to activate this on the title page you must pass the option 
%% 'fixed' to \maketitle, otherwise it will use \today
\date{05}{2015}
\author{Lowly Candidate}
%% The next command takes 3 mandatory and 1 optional argument.
%% The optional argument is the number of previous degrees held
%% by the candidate and defaults to 1. The mandatory arguments
%% are semicolon separated lists of, respectively, the degrees 
%% held, years obtained, and schools conferring those degrees.
\previousdegrees[3]{%
  B.A. Chemistry; M.S. Physics; M.S. Mathematics }{%
  2000; 2002; 2007 }{%
  University of Somewhere; University of Nowhere; University of Nebraska %
}

\chair{Random Advisor}
%% The next command takes 1 mandatory and 1 optional argument.
%% The optional argument is the number of committee members.
%% defaults to 1. The mandatory argument is a semicolon 
%% separated list of names of the committee members.
\committee[3]{Other Member; Another Member; Y.A. Member}


%% The following commands default to 'Mathematical Sciences',
%% 'McMicken College of Arts and Sciences', and 'University 
%% of Cincinnati' if they are not explicitly set by the user.
\department{Mathematical Sciences}
\college{Eponymous College of Arts and Sciences}
\university{University of Somewhere}

\begin{document} 

%%%%% Add the glossary definition file
\input{glossary-definitions}

%%%%% This starts the beginning material of the document. It resets the page
%%%%% numbering to start at 1 and to display as roman numerals.
\frontmatter

%%%%% This typesets the title page as defined by the uc-dissertation class.
%%%%% It takes an optional argument which, if set to 'fixed', displays the
%%%%% month and year for the date defined above by \newdate instead of \today.
\maketitle      %% or \maketitle[fixed]

%% This command typesets the abstract defined by the user with the \abstract
%% command. It starts a new page (on the right if the document is two-sided),
%% and adds the abstract to the Table of Contents (really it typesets a 
%% chapter).
\abstractpage

%% This makes the copyright page. It takes an optional argument which allows 
%% the user to choose from multiple copyrights. The default is 'all': the 
%% author reserves all rights to the document. This may be necessary depending 
%% on journal restrictions. However, by setting the optional argument to empty, 
%% i.e. [], the user can obtain a blank page instead of a copyright page (one
%% of these two things is required by UC. Also, by using the strings 'cc',
%% 'by','nc','nd', and 'sa', the user may choose a Creative Commons license.
%% The only two accepted by UC are 'cc-by-nc-nd' and 'cc-by-nc-sa'. Note that
%% the dashes are not strictly necessary and order doesn't matter. It is up to
%% the user to come up with a valid Creative Commons license.
%%
%% TODO: add a 'custom' option which allows the user to build the copyright 
%% page from scratch.
\copyrightpage
%% The above is equivalent to \copyrightpage[all]
%% \copyrightpage[]
%% \copyrightpage[cc-by-nc-nd]
%% \copyrightpage[cc-by-nc-sa]


%% This command typesets the acknowledgments defined by the user with the 
%% \acknowledgments command. It starts a new page (on the right if the document 
%% is two-sided), and adds the acknowledgments to the Table of Contents (really 
%% it typesets a chapter).
\acknowledgmentspage

%% Typeset the table of contents
\tableofcontents 

%% Typeset the list of tables
\listoftables

%% Typeset the list of figures
\listoffigures

%% List of Illustrations
%%
%% This is probably one of the trickier elements of the dissertation if you have
%% need of it. However, I will describe one way it can be accomplished. First, 
%% you will want to create custom float, say 'illustration', and then create a 
%% special command called \listofillustrations to typeset the list. For 
%% information about custom floats, see 
%%
%% http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions#Custom_floats
%%
%% and the package 'float'. For information about creating a \listofillustrations
%% command, see
%%
%% http://texblog.org/2008/07/13/define-your-own-list-of/
%% 
%% and the package 'tocloft'. 

%% Typeset the symbol list

%%%%% This starts page numbering anew, with arabic numerals as opposed to the roman
%%%%% numerals of the front matter.

\printbibliography

%%%%% We have to use mainmatter again for spacing issues and for the correct

%%%%% Below we use the mainmattertwo command defined by the uc-dissertation
%%%%% class so that the page order is not reset.
